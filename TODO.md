## Phase 05B — GA4 / Search Console OAuth

**Fully working end-to-end in production as of 2026-09-06**, verified with a real
Google account — both connections show real data (Search Console pulled actual
search queries for manekhadya.com; GA4 connected and reports "no data" honestly,
since that property has no ecommerce tracking configured, not a bug). All setup
items closed:

- [x] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` added to `/etc/paisamap/db.env`.
- [x] Redirect URI `https://paisamaps.com/api/analytics/oauth/callback` registered.
- [x] Consent-screen scopes + test user configured.
- [x] Real end-to-end test — both providers connected, property/site picked,
      report/ecommerce/location-tags all pulling real data.
- [x] Fixed two real production bugs surfaced only by this real-account test
      (neither existed in the mocked test suite, since both are proxy/DNS-layer
      issues, not app logic): (1) nginx never forwarded `X-Forwarded-Proto`, so
      Flask always built the OAuth redirect_uri as `http://` — fixed via
      `ProxyFix` in `server.py` (commit `aff9a0b`) + `proxy_set_header
      X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;` added to nginx (server-side, not tracked in
      this repo). (2) `www.paisamaps.com` was served directly instead of
      redirecting to the apex, so a request landing on `www` built a redirect_uri
      Google didn't recognize — fixed with a dedicated 443 redirect block on the
      server. (3) Also enable a third GCP API if not done — **Google Analytics
      Admin API** (`analyticsadmin.googleapis.com`) — needed for the property
      picker, separate from the Data API.

- [ ] (Later, not a blocker) Verify `paisamaps.com` in Search Console under this
      GCP project — needed only when submitting for Google's standard
      sensitive-scope verification.
